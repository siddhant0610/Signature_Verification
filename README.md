# Signature Verification & Digital Signature Generation using Deep Learning

## 🔥 Overview
This project aims to build an AI-powered handwritten signature verification system using Deep Learning embeddings (ArcFace + ResNet / Siamese Network).
Users can enroll their signatures, and later the system can verify new signatures against the stored embedding to determine authenticity.

The goal is to create a practical, production-ready digital signature pipeline where, after verification, the system can generate a digital signature token which can be used for secure document signing (PDF/online use).
